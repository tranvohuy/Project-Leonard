A famous mathematician whose first name is Leonard. His last name is X.
Google Project X + Problem 269 will give the website.

This is a fun problem. The main requirement is to write a code in whatever language that can run in less than 1 min and give a correct answer.

The problem is stated in Project269.jpg.

Since one should not public the solution, I just put it here to say that I can do the problem by coding in python.
